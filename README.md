# JaggedArrays

This project demonstrates the use of **Jagged Arrays** in Java.

## Features
- Declares a jagged array with fixed rows and variable columns.
- Stores student marks with different subject counts.
- Calculates **sum** and **average** for each student.
- Finds the student with the **highest average** dynamically.

## Example Output
Student 0 sum = 175
Student 0 avg = 87.5
Student 1 sum = 320
Student 1 avg = 80.0
Student 2 sum = 256
Student 2 avg = 85.33333333333333

Top student is Student 0 with highest average = 87.5
